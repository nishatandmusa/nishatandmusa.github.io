Bryce Canyon Country is a stunning region located in southern Utah, home to several national and state parks, including Bryce Canyon National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and Kodachrome Basin State Park. This area is famous for its unique geological formations, such as hoodoos, slot canyons, and towering red rock cliffs. 

This Spring, we had the opportunity to go for a 4-day trip to southern Utah in partnership with the [Bryce Canyon Country](https://www.brycecanyoncountry.com). It was a perfect amount of time to explore some of the best highlights of this region. The nearby airports are in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. For this trip, we flew into Las Vegas and then drove to Bryce Canyon National Park. You can also fly to Salt lake city and drive to Escalante, Utah.


## Day 1: Arrival in Las Vegas and Drive to Bryce Canyon National Park

Our adventure in Bryce Canyon Country started with our arrival at Las Vegas airport. After landing in Las Vegas, we rented a car and drove towards Bryce Canyon National Park, which is about a 4-hour drive away. The drive was scenic, passing through several small towns and beautiful desert landscapes.

Upon arriving at Bryce Canyon National Park, we headed straight to the visitor center to get information about the park and hiking trails. Next, we drove along the Bryce Canyon road and stopped at several viewpoints to enjoy the stunning views. Some part of the road was closed during our visit, but we could stop at the “Natural Bridge” overlook for some incredible views of red rock landscapes. If you have more time, we would also recommend taking a short walk along the “Bristlecone Loop trail” at Yovimpa Point to see beautiful rock layers. 

Later in the day, we headed to the Rim trail. The rim trail along the edge of the canyon between Sunrise to Sunset points is an easy hike and offers stunning views of the park's hoodoos and cliffs. We ended our first day enjoying the beautiful sunset over the hoodoos from this trail.

## Where to Stay in Bryce Canyon National Park

Bryce Canyon National Park has several options for lodging and camping. Bryce Canyon Lodge is a historic lodge located in the heart of the park and offers cabins and motel rooms. It is operated by the National Park Service and reservations can be made online. There are two campgrounds inside the park, Sunset Campground is open year-round and North Campground is only open between May to October. There are a few other lodging options near Bryce Canyon National Park. We stayed in [Ruby’s Inn](https://www.rubysinn.com). It is the largest lodging option outside the park's entrance. It also has a great restaurant, a large gift shop, and a pool.


## Day 2: Bryce Canyon National Park to Escalante

We started our day early to catch the sunrise at Bryce Point. It was only a 10-minute drive from Ruby’s Inn. This viewpoint offers stunning views of the park's hoodoos, cliffs, and canyons. When the first light of the sun hits the red hoodoos, it felt unreal! It was the perfect way to start our day and take some beautiful photos.

After watching the sunrise, we went back to Ruby’s Inn to have some breakfast. Then we headed to the Queens Garden trail. The most popular hike in Bryce Canyon National Park is The Navajo and Queens Garden Loop trail. We wanted to start at the Navajo Trail. However, the Navajo trail was closed when we went there in Spring. So we just did Queens Garden Trail. If the Navajo trail is open when you visit Bryce Canyon National Park, do this loop trail. This is a total 3-mile hike that takes you down into the canyon, passing by several of the park's famous hoodoos. The trail is rated as moderate and takes about 2-3 hours to complete. Be sure to wear sturdy hiking shoes and bring plenty of water and snacks.

After the hike, we drove towards Escalante, which is just under a 1-hour drive away. We took Scenic Byway 12 to get there. This is one of the most beautiful roads in Utah and there are lots of beautiful overlooks along the way to Escalante. 

Once in Escalante, we headed to the Peekaboo Slot Canyon trail. The Peekaboo Slot Canyon is a 3.5-mile round-trip hike that takes you through a narrow and winding slot canyon. The trail is rated as moderate and takes about 3-4 hours to complete. The hardest part of the Peek-A-Boo slot canyon comes right at the beginning. Just to gain access to the slot canyon, you need to climb a 12-foot wall, which can be a little tricky. But it becomes easier with some help from a partner. Be sure to wear sturdy hiking shoes and bring plenty of water and snacks.

Later in the day, we headed to the Devil's Garden for a beautiful sunset. Devil's Garden is part of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and has many unique rock formations. This area is also known for its unique sandstone arches, perfect for taking photos.

## Day 3: Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument

On our last full day at Escalante, we went for a hike in Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument. 

We started our day with an 8.5-mile hike to a spectacular natural wonder, Cosmic Ashtray. This unique geological feature is a circular depression in the sandstone that resembles a giant ashtray. To give you some idea, it initially reminded us of a giant sandbox filled with super soft orange sand. While the Ashtray is remarkable, the hike to reach this strange formation is also exciting. There is no designated trail as you meander your way through the beauty of the desert. It’s also unlikely to find many other hikers on this trail, which makes the journey both thrilling and serene. Make sure to download the offline map for this trail from “AllTrails”

If you aren’t up for a big hike, You can hike to the very popular Lower Calf Creek Fall. This 6-mile hike will take you to the bottom of a 130 ft waterfall.

Alternatively, if you are into a slot canyon hike, go for the Zebra slot canyon hike. This 5-mile hike is relatively easy getting to the actual slot with the difficulty slightly increasing once you enter inside. We would recommend leaving any large backpacks at the entrance so it will be easier to maneuver, as well as wearing water shoes since there can be water ankle to chest deep.

After doing the Cosmic Ashtray hike, we stopped for lunch in Escalante, then drove to Grosvenor Arch, a stunning double arch located in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The road to the Grosnover Arch has some potholes. We recommend a 4x4 car for going to this arch.

Finally, we caught the sunset from Kodachrome Basin State Park, another stunning natural area known for its colorful rock formations and unique geology.

## Day 4: Departure from Bryce Canyon Country

On the final day of our trip, we spent some time enjoying coffee on the front porch of the Escalante Escapes. Then we packed our bags and headed to Las Vegas. On our way to the airport, we stopped along the scenic viewpoints at Red Canyon and admired the stunning views of the red rock landscape one last time.
