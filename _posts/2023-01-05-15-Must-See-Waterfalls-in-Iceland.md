Iceland, the land of fire and ice, and obviously the land of waterfalls! There are more than 10000 waterfalls in Iceland. And probably only 200 of them have names. If you are planning an Iceland trip and trying to make a list of what places to go, you probably have heard of Skogafoss, Seljalandsfoss, and Gullfoss. But these are just a few of the best waterfalls in Iceland.

During our two-week trip to Iceland, we drove along so many waterfalls. However, if you are going on a short trip or can’t make it to all of them, here is a list of our favorite 15 waterfalls in Iceland. Some of these are just a walk from your car and some may need a hike. 

Here are our top 15 Iceland waterfalls with their exact location. You will find a map with all these waterfalls at the end.

Here are our top 15 waterfalls. We listed them in counterclockwise order around the country, starting in South Iceland.


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Seljalandsfoss</h3>

Seljalandsfoss Waterfall is one of the first waterfalls you’ll see if you drive south on Ring Road from Reykjavik. You can walk behind this 200 ft (60m) waterfall and this is one of the most popular waterfalls in Iceland. 

You can get a chance to take pictures of a rainbow by water spray on a sunny day. The location of Seljalandsfoss makes it a breathtaking sunset destination.

**How to visit Seljalandsfoss:** You can see this one from your car. You need to pay 700 ISK (as of June 2022) for the parking there. It’s just a 5-minute walk from the parking lot to the base of the waterfall.

### Gljúfrafoss

While you’re at Seljalandsfoss, don’t forget to visit Gljúfrafoss, which is just a 10 min walk from Seljalandsfoss. Gljúfrafoss is a hidden waterfall tucked inside a cave. 

Be prepared to get wet while going inside the cave. We would recommend having waterproof clothes and gear if you plan to go inside.

### Skogafoss
Hands down, Skogafoss is the most iconic and famous waterfall in Iceland. You can definitely feel the power of this waterfall while standing in front of it.

If you want to have this popular waterfall for yourselves, be there early. If you are camping in Iceland, you can camp at the foot of this iconic waterfall, and visit it during Sunrise. We camped there and literally had this just for ourselves for over an hour.

**How to visit Skogafoss:** Like Seljalandfoss, you can see Skogafoss from the road. To see this waterfall upfront, park in the large free parking lot and walk for only a minute to get to the waterfall.

### Kvernufoss

Just beside Skogafoss, Kvernufoss is another beautiful waterfall in Iceland. You can walk behind this waterfall like Seljalandfoss. But this is much smaller in size.

**How to visit Kvernufoss:** You can park at the Skogar museum and walk for 15 minutes to get to the waterfall. You need to pay at the museum for parking your car there, even if you don’t plan to go to the museum. Please remember, Kvernufoss is on private property, so be on the trail.

### Hangandifoss and Mulafoss

Hangandifoss is one of Iceland's tallest waterfalls and offers you amazing views. It's part of the Múlagljúfur canyon with another beautiful Mulafoss waterfall. 

**How to visit Hangandifoss and Mulafoss:** The hike to Hangandifoss starts at the same parking lot of the  Múlagljúfur canyon. The parking lot is located near to the Fjallsárlón glacier lagoon.  A 4wd or 4x4 car isn’t necessary to get there but the road isn’t the best so take it slow.

### Hengifoss

The unique red clay sandwiched between the rock layers makes Hengifoss one of the most unique waterfalls in Iceland. This 420 ft (130 m) waterfall is the 2nd largest waterfall in East Iceland. 

You need to do a moderate 3 miles hike to get to this beautiful waterfall. The whole trail has a sweeping view of the surrounding areas and you will pass another waterfall “Litlanesfoss”.

### Gufufoss

Gufufoss is another hidden gem of East Iceland. This is the largest of the hundred waterfalls in the Seyðisfjörður area. 

Gufufoss looks the same as the Skogafoss waterfall. The only difference is this is far more peaceful and smaller than the Skogafoss waterfall. You will probably be the only person there to enjoy the waterfall.

**How to visit Gufufoss:** There is a parking lot along highway 93. You can just park there and you will be at the bottom of the waterfall in 5 minutes.

### Dettifoss

Located in North Iceland, Dettifoss is one of Europe’s most powerful waterfalls. You can see the mist of Dettofoss from miles away and when you get right up to the waterfall you can feel the power. 

You can see Dettifoss from the East and West sides of Jökulsá á Fjöllum river. You can get very close to the falls on both sides.

**How to visit Dettifoss:** The West side of Dettifoss has an overlook and is very easy to access. If you want to go to the East side, you have to drive a long distance on the dirt road. Both sides have a free parking lot.

### Selfoss

Another beautiful waterfall in North Iceland is Selfoss. This sits just beside the Dettifoss.  It may not be powerful like Dettifoss, but Selfoos is a more elegant one. 

Like the Dettifoss, You can see Selfoss from the East and West sides of Jökulsá á Fjöllum river. But from the west side, you can see only a part of the waterfall.

**How to visit Selfoss:** It has the same parking lot as Dettifoss on both the east and west sides. You need to walk past Dettifoss on both sides to get to Selfoss.

### Goðafoss

Goðafoss also called “Waterfall of the Gods” is one of the most beautiful sights in Iceland. It is located just off the ring road in North Iceland. 

**How to visit Goðafoss:** There are two viewpoints on either side of the river. Parking is free on both sides. It’s a popular place in Iceland. Visit there early in the morning or late afternoon, to get this place less crowded. 

### Dynjandi

The magnificent Dynjandi is an insane cascading waterfall in Iceland's  Westfjords. This is called the “Jewel of Westfjords” and is worth the detour from the ring road of Iceland.

You need to hike a mile to go to the bottom of Dynjandi. You will pass 6 other waterfalls along the hike and the panoramic views of the fjords from the hiking trail are otherworldly.

**How to visit Dynjandi:** Dynjandi is in the Westfjords of Iceland. The road to get to the parking lot is not F - road. However, we would recommend having a 4x4 or 4WD car. You can park in the large parking lot and hike for 15-20 minutes to get to the bottom of Dynjandi.


### Kirkjufellsfoss

You probably have seen lots of pictures of Kirkjufellsfoss. This is a very popular spot for photographers with panoramic views of an iconic waterfall & Kirkjufell mountain

**How to visit Kirkjufellsfoss:** Kirkjufellsfoss is in Iceland's Snaefellsnes Peninsula. You can park in the free parking lot just beside highway 54 and walk along the trail to the viewing spot.

### Sigöldugljúfur

Sigöldugljúfur, also known as the Valley of Tears, is a canyon in the Icelandic Highlands. It gets this nickname from its sheer number of waterfalls. 

Sigöldugljúfur is probably the best off-the-beaten-path location but is often overlooked by most visitors. If you are going to Landmannalaugar, it’s very easy to fit this into your itinerary.

**How to visit Sigöldugljúfur:** You need a 4x4 or 4WD car to get there, as this is located on F-208 road. From the parking lot, you need to walk 15 minutes to get to the canyon.


### Haifoss

Haifoss means “High waterfall”. This 396 ft (121m) waterfall was once recorded as the highest waterfall in Iceland. And that’s why it’s called Haifoss. Though it’s not the highest anymore, Haifoss is one of the highest waterfalls in Iceland.

This majestic waterfall is worth the detour from the iconic Landmannalaugar drive or a road trip from Golden Circle.

**How to visit Haifoss:** You can go there in a 2wd car. However, you have to drive a long distance on a dirt road to get to the parking lot. So we would recommend a 4x4 or 4wd car to get there. From the parking lot, you can get to the overlook in 5 minutes.

### Gullfoss

Gullfoss is one of the most popular spots in Golden Circle. Gullfoss is also called “Golden Falls”, Golden Circle was named after this.
